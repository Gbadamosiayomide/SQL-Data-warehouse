# SQL-Data-warehouse
# Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Data Engineering project that involves:
- **SQL Server**: Data storage, transformation, and querying.
- **Data Analytics**: Cleaning, processing, and analyzing data to extract insights.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting data from sources, transforming it, and loading it into SQL Server for analytics.
- **Visualization**: Using tools to present insights in a meaningful way.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **SQL (T-SQL)**
- **Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, etc.)**
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualization)
- **Apache Airflow** (for workflow automation)
